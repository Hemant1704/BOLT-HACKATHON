We not just limited to our solution to the problem statement specified 
We have added some features by ourselves to make it more better and for use in current requirment and scenario

Solution of problem statement 1(problem statement file in this repository refer that) 

We made a interface in which doctor can speak the word or sub heading he wants from the report and than it will give the doctor the set
of portions or pages from the file where the word or heading is threre with the word circled in red colour.
NLP was asked to involve thus we have taken speech voice of the doctor as input to our program.

1.First doctor gives the scanned file or pdf file as input
2.Doctor speaks the subheading or parameter he wants from the file(ex - "Give me tissue" or "Blood sugar") that is then connverted to text 
3.software will take the file given by doctor as input.
4.Then it converts the pdf file into a series or set of jpeg images and made a folder of it
5.This folder is again than taken as input and program extracts one by one each image and gets the text out from it
6.The text and the voice message are compared if any word matches
7. The index of the current page is stored and if the word matches that page is ready to show after complete execution of code
8. also around the matched word we make a box so that it can be easily seen by the doctor where the part is present he wants

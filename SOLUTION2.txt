SOLUTION TO PROBLEM 2:

We extended this and implememted our ideas to make this project better and beneficial to current medical scenario

We see that if a certain virus spreads in a certain area which is new and unknown the doctors are not able to identify it 
Specially if we take the example of corona virus... it spread in China but many countries still are not able to identify the
structure of the virus and how it affects a particular cell.

What our team decided to make is such a portal where any researcher can add the cell images even 10 20 or 30 images. So if we get images
of the cell from around the globe we made a program which identify the problematic area in effected or parasitized human cell 
using the contour detection method. The affected area in a cell was circles or spots so we decided to extract largest 5 contours 
Our software will then extract the features (the contour areas of the effected portion) and make a dataset file which can be made available
on the portal so that anywhere in the world a ml algorithm can be used over the dataset and the virus is identified easily.
We also implemented our own ml code which  gave us an accuracy of 90 to 93 percent.

We believe that this idea is realy nice and great to solve the problem of lack of dataset and image of a newly arrived disease.
